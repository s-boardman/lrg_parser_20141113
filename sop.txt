Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the LRG Gene File Parser

Introduction
The Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) project was undertaken to provide a consistent referencing system for variant reporting. With the formation of the project and the creation of over 400 public LRG’s there is a requirement to build tools to enable the convenient use of these reference sequences in diagnostic laboratories. 

This document aims to provide a guide for users to use the gene parser to extract information from LRG gene files in XML format, and produce a FASTA output file.


1.	Access the appropriate XML file
The appropriate LRG XML file should be downloaded from the LRG website (“www.lrg-sequence.org”) in XML format, and saved to the appropriate folder:

	LRG_PARSER_20141113


2.	Run the parser 
Run the parser on the newly downloaded LRG XML file to create the FASTA output file.

  2a. Run the command, with no intron flags 

	      Python lrg.py LRG_292.xml LRG_292.fa

        *LRG_292 is used as an example; please insert the name of your file here.

  2b. Run the command, with intron flags

        Python lrg.py LRG_292.xml LRG_292.fa –i -10

        *-10 will provide the 10 flanking bases of the intron sequence around the relevant exon sequence,  this can be replaced to reflect the number of flanking integers you require.


3.	The command run above will have created a file in FASTA format.
